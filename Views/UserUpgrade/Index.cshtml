<h1>Upgrade Users</h1>
<p>Welcome to the automated user upgrade script. In Umbraco 5.1, User / Members went through some major changes requiring a number of updates to the database schema. To help with the upgrade of any existing users, we provide you with this upgrade tool.</p>
<p>Before you perform the upgrade, it is advised that you firstly backup your database incase anything does go wrong.</p>
<p>Once you have backed up your database, please <a href="@Url.Action("Upgrade", "UserUpgrade")">click here</a> to start the user upgrade.</p>
